Collation

SQL Server by default is case insensitive. But if we need to enforce case sensitivity on a column, while executing a query, we need to change the Collation of the column. The default collation of SQL Server is SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS, which is case insensitive.

We can change the collation of a column using the COLLATE clause.

Example

SELECT * FROM MY_TABLE
WHERE COLUMN1 = ‘axVty’

If the same query is rewritten as:

SELECT * FROM MY_TABLE
WHERE COLUMN1 COLLATE Latin1_General_CS_AS = ‘axVty’

this will enforce case sensitivity on the search on Column1 column.

If we need to permanently change a collation of a particular column, we can alter the table as:

ALTER TABLE MY_TABLE
ALTER COLUMN COLUMN1 VARCHAR(20)
COLLATE Latin1_General_CS_AS
