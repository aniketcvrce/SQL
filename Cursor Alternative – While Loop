Scenario

Within a SQL Procedure, we usually go for a Cursor if an iteration is required.

But cursors might not be used in every case; especially in the Synapse database where Cursors are not supported. Thus, need to try out alternatives to Cursor.

This is achieved by using a temporary table and a While loop.

Code

/*create a temporary table */

IF OBJECT_ID(N’tempdb..#tmpTables’) IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
DROP TABLE #tmpTables
END

create table #tmpTables
with (
DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN
)
AS select distinct  [GROUP] from [YOUR TABLE] ;

/*set some counter values */

declare @group varchar(100)
DECLARE @counter int = 1
DECLARE @recordCount int = (SELECT COUNT(1) from #tmpTables)

/*while loop for the length of the row count of the temp table */

WHILE @counter <= @recordCount

BEGIN 

/*select the value from temp table for the nth iteration */


SET @group = (SELECT [GROUP]
      FROM(SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY [GROUP]) AS RN
      FROM #tmpTables) as T
      WHERE RN = @counter)

      PRINT @group

      SET @counter = @counter + 1 

/*do your business logic here and can use the iteration value @group */

END
