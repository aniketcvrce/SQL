Deleting duplicates from a table comes into play mostly when a bulk insert is performed from an external source with no constraints. Now, the destination table needs to be cleaned.

If your table doesnâ€™t have an identity column, do create one surrogate key (later you may delete it). The table must have identity column, which will be used to identify the duplicate records.

Suppose MyTable in example is has ID as Identity Column and Columns which have duplicate data are DuplicateColumn1, DuplicateColumn2 and DuplicateColumn3.

DELETE
FROM MyTable
WHERE ID NOT IN
(
SELECT MAX(ID)
FROM MyTable
GROUP BY DuplicateColumn1, DuplicateColumn2, DuplicateColumn3)
