Sometimes, we may need to write a query which must return a single value. Tis situation arises when the query’s output is used in subsequent tasks in a solution, for ex. SSIS.

If we write a general select query, there may be some conditions, which may return nothing for the run; while the wizard or task, which runs the query, always expects a single value; in which case, no data will lead to faliure.

Thus, we need to return a default value if the query returns nothing. The following example demonstrates how to return a default value from a query if nothing is found:

We need to select the daily currency conversion rate from a table. If for any day, there is no conversion rate data present in the table, the query would return no data. Thus, to prevent such situation, we need to use a UNION ALL and NOT EXISTS clauses to return a default value.

SELECT CONVERSION_RATE RATE
FROM CURRECNY_CONVERSION
WHERE FROM_CURRENCY = ‘EUR’
AND TO_CURRENCY = ‘USD’
AND CONVERSION_DATE = GETDATE()
UNION ALL
SELECT 1 AS RATE
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
SELECT CONVERSION_RATE RATE
FROM CURRECNY_CONVERSION
WHERE FROM_CURRENCY = ‘EUR’
AND TO_CURRENCY = ‘USD’
AND CONVERSION_DATE = GETDATE()
)
